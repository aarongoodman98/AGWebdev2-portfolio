    <h3>Benefits Of Using Facebook</h3>
    
    <p>Most of your students would already be using facebook outside college or school, so making it a part of your curriculum provides a comfortable way for you're students to take part in class. Since they'll be on facebook more often they will consume the uploaded content more, so they'll be thinking about the work more and engaging more in class more frequently. As a teacher using facebook with their students you can show them how to use the site responsibly so it helps their future not harm it. Also if you the teacher have stayed in contact with past school friends who've gone on and worked in different careers you can use facebook as a way to source guest speakers for your students.</p>

    <h3>Tip/Tricks For Teachers</h3>
    
    <p>As a teacher you should have two different accounts if you decide to use facbook personally, by doing so you keep your facebook relationship at a professional level. When setting up groups make sure you friend your students in your teaching account whether they are a current or former student. To build up your students, let them know in the group by tagging them and letting them know their work was well done, do this by tagging them. If you have a class blog for work, link it to the Facebook group so the sudents can view it instantly after it's been uploaded or updated with work.</p>
